I am a recent graduate with a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Washington. I was 
	advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/">Amy Ko</a> and 
	<a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/">James Fogarty</a>. I researched systems and interfaces for UX/UI designers that apply techniques from diverse areas including program analysis, synthesis, constraint solving, and machine learning.

Through this research, I created systems to help interface designers explore and adapt
alternative and example interfaces, and analyze the usability of an interface without needing to collect any data. For this research, I collaborated with industry researchers through internships with <a href="https://research.adobe.com/">Adobe Research</a> and 
<a href="https://ai.google/research/">Google</a>, and have conducted over <b>100 interviews and study sessions</b> with interface designers. My research was supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.

Previously, I spent <b>3 years</b> working as a <b>full-time software development engineer</b> at Microsoft, where I helped build a web interface framework for Microsoft Dynamics, and specialized in user interface layout, patterns, and visual regression testing. 

I'm currently working at Apple as an AI and Accessibilty Researcher and Engineer.
