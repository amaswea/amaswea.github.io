I'm currently working at Apple as an AIML Research Scientist. I develop human-centered AI tools for accelerating developers, and train machine learning models for understanding user interfaces. I also build large-scale data collection pipelines for collecting human-labeled datasets to train these models. I have a strong interest in building better tools to help developers make their interfaces more accessible. I have developed and released production level code for multiple features at Apple, including Screen Recognition and Accessibility Inspector.  

<b>Achievements</b>
<ul>
  <li>Accessibility Developer Tools: Developed a large scale system to collect and report accessibility issues for mobile apps, used for internal accessibilty reporting for multiple prominent Apple apps, and released as an Xcode feature in Accessibility Inspector.</li>
  <li>UI Understanding: Developed ML driven internal framework (Swift and Python) used by 20+ teams and products to recognize UI elements. </li>
  <li>Screen Recognition: The first on-device ML model to recognize and announce iOS app UI for VoiceOver, benefiting 20M+ blind users. CHI Best Paper award. </li>
  <li>Recognized expert on accessibility developer tools.</li>
</ul>

<b>Graduate School</b>: I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Washington. I was 
	advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/">Amy Ko</a> and 
	<a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/">James Fogarty</a>. I researched systems and interfaces for UX/UI designers that apply techniques from diverse areas including program analysis, synthesis, constraint solving, and machine learning.

Through this research, I created systems to help interface designers explore and adapt
alternative and example interfaces, and analyze the usability of an interface without needing to collect any data. For this research, I collaborated with industry researchers through internships with <a href="https://research.adobe.com/">Adobe Research</a> and 
<a href="https://ai.google/research/">Google</a>, and have conducted over <b>100 interviews and study sessions</b> with interface designers. My research was supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.

<b>Industry</b>: Previously, I spent <b>3 years</b> working as a <b>full-time software development engineer</b> at Microsoft, where I helped build a web interface framework for Microsoft Dynamics, and specialized in user interface layout, patterns, and visual regression testing.
